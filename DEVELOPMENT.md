# Development

1. Clone the repository.
2. ```vit/command_line.py``` is the entry point for the application. To run it without a full installation:
    * Set the ```PYTHONPATH``` environment variable to the root directory of the repository
    * Run it with ```python vit/command_line.py```
    * A snazzier option is to create a command line alias. For bash:
        * ```alias vit='PYTHONPATH=[path_to_root_dir] python vit/command_line.py'```
